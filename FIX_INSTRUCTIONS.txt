CRITICAL FIX - ID Mismatch After Config Refactor

PROBLEM: Your player save file uses OLD IDs but templates use NEW IDs

Upgrade IDs Changed:
- perTap -> tap-power
- perHour -> passive-income  
- energyMax -> energy-capacity
- criticalChance -> critical-chance

Character IDs Changed:
- shadow -> dark-assassin
- frost -> ice-warrior

FIX: Run this command:

  node migrate-complete.js

Then:
1. Restart server
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Test upgrades and character selection

This will rename all IDs in your player-state.json to match the new templates.
A backup file will be created automatically.
